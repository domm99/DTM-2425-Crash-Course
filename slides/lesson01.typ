#slide(title:"Cache memory")[
  - Historically, #alert[CPUs have always been faster than memories]. Memory is a #underline[bottleneck] for the CPU performance
  - Actually, the problem is both #alert[technology and economics]
    - Engineers know how to build memories that are as fast as CPUs, BUT #underline[they have to be located on the CPU chip]
    - Going over the bus to memory is #underline[very slow]
    - Putting a large memory on the CPU chip makes it #underline[bigger], which makes it #underline[more expensive], and even if cost were not an issue, there are #underline[limits to how big a CPU chip can be made]
  - The #alert[solution] is having a #underline[small amount of fast memory] and a #underline[large amount of slow memory]
  - This small and fast memory is called #alert[cache]

  - The basic idea behind a cache is simple: the #alert[most heavily used memory words are kept in the cache]. When the CPU needs a word, it first looks in the cache. Only if the word is not there does it go to main memory
  - What are the “most heavily used memory words”? We can rely on 2 #underline[principles]:
    - #alert[Spatial locality]: if a particular storage location is referenced at a particular time, then it is likely that nearby memory locations will be referenced in the near future
    - #alert[Temporal locality]: if at one point a particular memory location is referenced, then it is likely that the same location will be referenced again in the near future
  - We have a #alert[hit] when a word is in the cache, otherwise there is a miss

    - #alert[Cache organization]: if the cache is full, how to define which spaces to free? We need specific policies
    - #alert[Number of caches]: usually chips have a primary (L1) cache on chip, a secondary (L2) cache off chip but in the same package, and a third (L3) cache still further away

#slide(title:"4th Generation: Very Large Scale Integration (1980-?)")[
  - 1971: the italian _Federico Faggin_ created the first #underline[microprocessor], the Intel 4004
  - #underline[Millions] (not dozen) of transistors on a single chip. This development soon led to #underline[smaller] and #underline[faster] computer: the beginning of the #alert[Personal Computer (PC)] era

#slide(title:"5th Generation: Invisible Computers")[
  - The real fifth generation is more a #alert[paradigm shift] than a specific new architecture
  - We can refer to this generation also with _Ubiquitous Computing_ or _Pervasive Computing_
  - rather than having a _small number of very powerful computing devices_ in your life (laptops, tablets, phones, music players and so on), you might have a _large number of smart devices_ which are perhaps less powerful (“simpler”)

  How can we communicate with a computer?

#slide(title:"Communicating with computers")[
  - #underline[Computers understand only the machine language] (a sequence of binary symbols 0 and 1)- 
  - Why? Simplifying, with the machine language we are #underline[turning on/off] the circuits and functional units inside the circuits of a compute

  #figure(image("images/communication.png", width:45%))

#slide(title:"Machine language")[
  - #alert[Machine Language:] a set of #underline[instructions directly executed by the hardware]
    - Machine language is a (very) #underline[low-level programming language], that generally consists of numbers, i.e. the binary code
    -  The execution is #underline[extremely fast], but the instruction set is limited due to cost and complexity
    - Unfortunately, the #alert[machine language is really hard for humans]

    #figure(image("images/machinelanguage.png", width:30%))
]

#slide(title:"Machine Language")[
  - The #alert[first generation of software] (late 1940s) had its #underline[instructions written directly in machine language]
  -  Unfortunately, #alert[programming in machine language is extremely difficult], especially when programs become more complex
  - A #alert[solution] for the machine language complexity can be represented by the use of an #alert[intermediate language] that is #alert[comprehensible by humans]
  - Then, we have to #alert[translate this new language] into the machine language
]

#slide(title:"Machine Language conversion")[
  #align(center)[ The same happens with #alert[humans] ]

  #figure(image("images/translation.png", width:75%))

#slide(title:"Assembly Language")[
  - One of the first solutions is to use the #alert[assembly language]
  - Indeed, in assembly language instructions can be represented with the help of #alert[mnemonics] (such as mov, add, sub, end. ...) that are #alert[human-readable commands]

  #figure(image("images/assembly.png", width:40%))

  - Unfortunately, #alert[also the assembly language became hard to be used] by programmers to write more and more complex programs
]

#slide(title:"Assembly Language")[
  - Why? Because having a more human-friendly language #alert[we started to build more complex systems] which however required even more friendly languages
  - The solution is to create #alert[a new “easier” language] (L1) and a «translator» to translate the easier language to the assembly (or machine) language (L0). L1 will be runned on a sort of #alert[Virtual Machine] (e.g., Java Virtual Machine)
]

#slide(title:"Multilevel Machines")[
  #align(center)[This solution can be #alert[repeated] again to create #alert[new higher-level languages] easier for humans and with respect to the application to be developed]

  #figure(image("images/multilevel.png", width:80%))

#slide(title:"Compilers vs Interpreters")[
  - There are two types of translators: #alert[compilers] and #alert[intepreters]
  - Both compiler and interpreters #alert[do the same job] which is converting higher level programming languages to lower logical levels
  - However, there are some differences:
    - #alert[Compiler]: converts the code into machine code before program run
    - #alert[Interpreter]: convert code into machine code when the program is running (a sort of “simultaneous translation”)
  - Compiler vs Interpreter
    - Compiled code #underline[runs faster], since can be better optimized for a specific architecture
    - Interpreted code runs slower but has a #underline[better portability]
