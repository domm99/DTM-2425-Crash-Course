  History of Programming Paradigms
]

#slide(title: "Programming Paradigms")[
  - What is a #alert[paradigm]?
    - A paradigm (in programming) refers to a #underline[style or way of thinking about and structuring code to solve problems]
    - #underline[Different paradigms approach problems from different angles], using distinct techniques and strategies

  - #alert[Evolution] of programming paradigms:
    - As computing hardware advanced, so did the complexity of software
    - Different paradigms emerged to solve new problems, manage complexity, and improve productivity

]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[
  #align(center)[
    _#alert[Imperative programming] is a paradigm that focuses on describing #alert[how] a program operates through #alert[explicit step-by-step instructions], detailing how the #alert[state] of the program #alert[changes over time]_
  ]
]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[

  === Sum of the first 10 numbers in C

  ```c
int main() {
  int sum = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
      sum += i;
  }
  printf("Sum of first 10 numbers is %d\n", sum);
  return 0;
}
  ```
]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[

  === History
  - #alert[1950s - 1960s]: origin of imperative Programming
  - Languages like #alert[Fortran] (1957) and #alert[Algol] (1958) were among the first to implement imperative concepts
  - #alert[C] (1972) became #alert[one of the most popular imperative languages] and laid the foundation for many modern languages like Java and C++
  - These languages were designed to take advantage of the #alert[Von Neumann architecture] of computers, which operates with a sequence of instructions acting on memory
]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[

  === Key Characteristics
  - #alert[Sequential execution:] code is executed one instruction at a time, in a predefined order
  - #alert[State and mutation:] the program's state is stored in variables, which can change (mutate) over time
  - #alert[Control flow]: programmers have explicit control over the flow of execution using constructs like:
    - Loops (for, while)
    - Conditional statements (if, else, switch)
    - Function calls
  - #alert[Memory management:] in earlier imperative languages like C, developers had to manually manage memory allocation and deallocation
]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[
  === Advantages 
    - #alert[Straightforward control:] offers explicit control over how a program runs and how its state evolves, making it easy to write simple scripts or perform low-level tasks
    - #alert[Close to machine language:] especially in languages like C, imperative programming provides direct manipulation of memory and system resources, making it suitable for performance-critical applications like operating systems and device drivers
    - #alert[Wide applicability:] suitable for a broad range of applications, from system programming to general-purpose programming
]

#slide(title: "Imperative Programming")[
  === Disadvantages 
  - #alert[Complexity in large systems:] as the complexity of the program grows, managing state and flow control manually becomes cumbersome and error-prone
  - #alert[Hard to reason about:] programs with many mutable variables and complex flow (e.g., nested loops and conditionals) can become difficult to debug, maintain, and understand
  - #alert[Less modularity and reusability:] code often lacks the modularity and reuse seen in object-oriented programming due to its reliance on global state and tight coupling between operations
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)")[

  #align(center)[
    _#alert[Object-oriented programming] (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes code by bundling related #alert[data] and #alert[methods] into #alert[objects], which represent entities or concepts from the #alert[real world] or problem domain_
  ]

  #v(2em)

  #arrow The central concept of OOP is that objects #alert[interact] with one another to #alert[perform tasks], and programs are constructed as #alert[networks of these interacting objects]
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[
  #figure(image("images/oop.jpg"))
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[

  === History
  - #alert[1960s - 1980s:] OOP concepts first appeared in Simula (1960s), a simulation language designed for modeling real-world processes
  - #alert[1970s:] Smalltalk fully implemented OOP principles, pioneering the core concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and message passing

  - #alert[1980s-1990s:] OOP became mainstream with the popularity of languages like C++ (1983) and Java (1995). These languages brought OOP into widespread use for everything from desktop applications to large-scale enterprise systems

  - #alert[Present]: Modern languages like Python, Kotlin, and Scala continue to embrace OOP, often combining it with other paradigms to maximize flexibility 
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[
  === How to define a class and create an object
```python
class Student:
  def __init__(self, name, surname):
    self.name = name
    self.surname = surname

  def greet(self):
    print(f"Hello! My name is {name}")


davide = Student('Davide', 'Domini')
davide.greet()

```
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[

  === Key Concepts of OOP: Encapsulation
  #align(center)[
    _Bundling #alert[data] (attributes) and #alert[methods] (functions) into a single unit called an #alert[object]. This #alert[hides the internal state of the object] and only #alert[exposes a public interface]._
  ]

```python
class Car:
  def __init__(self, model, color):
    self.model = model
    self.color = color
    
  def start_engine(self):
    print("Engine started")
```
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[
  === Key Concepts of OOP: Inheritance
  #align(center)[
    _#alert[Creating new classes based on existing ones], allowing for #alert[reuse] of common behavior and properties. This models an "is-a" relationship._
  ]
```python
class ElectricCar(Car):
  def start_engine(self):
    print("Electric motor started")
```
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[
  === Key Concepts of OOP: Abstraction
  
  #align(center)[
    _#alert[Simplifying] complex systems by providing a #alert[clear interface] and #alert[hiding the inner workings]. Abstraction allows programmers to focus on #alert[what] an object does, rather than #alert[how] it does it._
  ]
```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclass must implement this method")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")
print(dog.speak())  # Buddy says Woof!
print(cat.speak())  # Whiskers says Meow!

```
]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[

  === Advantages

  - #alert[Modularity:] classes and objects allow for clear modular design. Each object handles its own state and behavior, reducing dependencies and coupling between components
  - #alert[Code reuse:] through inheritance and polymorphism, common behavior can be abstracted and reused across different parts of a program
  - #alert[Scalability:] large systems can be broken down into smaller objects and components, making them easier to manage, extend, and maintain
  - #alert[Maintainability:] with encapsulation, changes to the internal workings of an object don't affect other parts of the codebase as long as the public interface remains the same

]

#slide(title: "Object-Oriented Programming")[

  === Disadvantages
  - #alert[Complexity:] OOP can introduce unnecessary layers of abstraction, making simple problems overly complex. For small programs, the overhead of defining classes and objects can be excessive
  - #alert[Performance overhead:] in some languages, OOP can lead to performance issues due to the abstraction layers, particularly when creating and managing many small objects.
  - #alert[Learning curve:] understanding concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns can be challenging for beginners

#slide(title: "Why New Paradigms were Needed")[
  - #alert[Complexity and Scalability:] as software grew, managing complex systems with just imperative techniques became difficult
  - #alert[Changing hardware architectures:] the rise of multi-core processors and distributed systems required new paradigms to handle concurrency and parallelism efficiently
  - #alert[Shift in software focus:] software has evolved to handle more complex tasks like UI design, web development, and artificial intelligence, which demand higher abstraction and modularity (OOP, functional programming)
